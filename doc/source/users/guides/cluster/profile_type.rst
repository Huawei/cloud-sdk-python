Working with Profile Types
==========================

A **profile** is a template used to create and manage nodes, i.e. objects
exposed by other OpenStack services. A profile encodes the information needed
for node creation in a property named ``spec``.


List Profile Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To examine the known profile types:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/profile_type.py
   :pyobject: list_profile_types

Full example: `manage profile type`_


Get Profile Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get the details about a profile type, you need to provide the name of it.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/profile_type.py
   :pyobject: get_profile_type

Full example: `manage profile type`_

.. _manage profile type: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/python-openstacksdk/tree/examples/cluster/profile_type.py
