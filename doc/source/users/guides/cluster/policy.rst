Managing Policies
=================

A **policy type**  can be treated as the meta-type of a `Policy` object. A
registry of policy types is built when the Cluster service starts. When
creating a `Policy` object, you will indicate the policy type used in its
`spec` property.


List Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To examine the list of policies:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/policy.py
   :pyobject: list_policies

When listing policies, you can specify the sorting option using the ``sort``
parameter and you can do pagination using the ``limit`` and ``marker``
parameters.

Full example: `manage policy`_


Create Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a policy, you will provide a dictionary with keys and values
according to the policy type referenced.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/policy.py
   :pyobject: create_policy

Optionally, you can specify a ``metadata`` keyword argument that contains some
key-value pairs to be associated with the policy.

Full example: `manage policy`_


Find Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~

To find a policy based on its name or ID:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/policy.py
   :pyobject: find_policy

Full example: `manage policy`_


Get Policy
~~~~~~~~~~

To get a policy based on its name or ID:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/policy.py
   :pyobject: get_policy

Full example: `manage policy`_


Update Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a policy is created, most of its properties are immutable. Still, you
can update a policy's ``name`` and/or ``metadata``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/policy.py
   :pyobject: update_policy

The Cluster service doesn't allow updating the ``spec`` of a policy. The only
way to achieve that is to create a new policy.

Full example: `manage policy`_


Delete Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A policy can be deleted after creation, provided that it is not referenced
by any active clusters or nodes. If you attempt to delete a policy that is
still in use, you will get an error message.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/policy.py
   :pyobject: delete_policy
