Working with Policy Types
=========================

A **policy** is a template that encodes the information needed for specifying
the rules that are checked/enforced before/after certain actions are performed
on a cluster. The rules are encoded in a property named ``spec``.


List Policy Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To examine the known policy types:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/policy_type.py
   :pyobject: list_policy_types

Full example: `manage policy type`_


Get Policy Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve the details about a policy type, you need to provide the name of
it.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cluster/policy_type.py
   :pyobject: get_policy_type

Full example: `manage policy type`_

.. _manage policy type: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/python-openstacksdk/tree/examples/cluster/policy_type.py
