Using OpenStack Cluster
=======================

Before working with the Cluster service, you'll need to create a connection
to your OpenStack cloud by following the :doc:`connect` user guide. This will
provide you with the ``conn`` variable used by all examples in this guide.

The primary abstractions/resources of the Cluster service are:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Profile Type <cluster/profile_type>
   Profile <cluster/profile>
   Cluster <cluster/cluster>
   Node <cluster/node>
   Policy Type <cluster/policy_type>
   Policy <cluster/policy>
   Receiver <cluster/receiver>
   Action <cluster/action>
   Event <cluster/event>
